## **Project Title**:  
**Priority-Based Task Scheduling Using Heuristic Methods**  

## **Project Description**:  
Task scheduling is a critical problem in computing systems where multiple tasks need to be executed efficiently while utilizing limited resources. This project aims to develop a **priority-based task scheduling system** that classifies incoming tasks based on their priority levels and allocates the best available resources using heuristic methods.  

The scheduling mechanism will consider factors such as **task urgency, execution time, and resource availability** to make optimal allocation decisions. By leveraging **heuristic algorithms**, the system will dynamically allocate resources to high-priority tasks, ensuring improved system efficiency, reduced waiting time, and optimized resource utilization.  

---

## **Project Goals**:  
1. **Task Classification**:  
   - Classify incoming tasks based on predefined **priority levels** (e.g., High, Medium, Low).  
   - Priorities may be assigned based on **deadlines, computational complexity, or user-defined criteria**.  

2. **Resource Identification**:  
   - Identify the **best available resources** (e.g., CPU, Memory, Network Bandwidth) for task execution using **heuristic approaches**.  
   - Factors such as **processing power, memory availability, and current workload** will be considered.  

3. **Heuristic-Based Scheduling and Allocation**:  
   - Implement heuristic scheduling methods to **dynamically assign resources** to tasks based on their priority levels.  
   - Ensure efficient execution with minimal waiting time and optimal CPU utilization.

## **Proposed Methodology**:  

1. **Task Prioritization**:  
   - Use priority-based classification such as:  
     - **High Priority** (Critical system tasks, real-time processing)  
     - **Medium Priority** (Standard computational tasks)  
     - **Low Priority** (Background processes, non-time-sensitive jobs)  

2. **Heuristic Scheduling Algorithms**:  
   The project will explore the following heuristic-based scheduling techniques:  
   - **Min-Min Algorithm** – Assigns the shortest execution time task to the least loaded resource.  
   - **Max-Min Algorithm** – Allocates the longest execution time task to the least loaded resource to balance workload.  
   - **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** – Uses evolutionary optimization to find the best task-resource assignment.  
   - **Simulated Annealing** – An optimization approach that explores various task allocations to improve efficiency.  
   - **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** – Inspired by ant foraging behavior, this method finds optimal scheduling paths.  

3. **Resource Allocation Mechanism**:  
   - Maintain a dynamic **resource pool** with real-time monitoring of available CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth.  
   - Assign tasks using a **greedy heuristic** approach to maximize throughput and minimize delays.  

4. **Implementation Workflow**:  
   - **Input**: Incoming tasks with execution parameters (e.g., time required, priority).  
   - **Processing**: Assign priority, select best-fit heuristic, allocate resources.  
   - **Output**: Efficient scheduling with minimized response time and optimal resource usage.

## **Expected Outcome**:  
- A **priority-based scheduling system** that efficiently allocates resources using heuristic methods.  
- Comparative analysis of different heuristic techniques in terms of **execution time, resource utilization, and system throughput**.  
- A simulated test environment demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.  


For the above project I want to implement a website which can show the performance of each algorithm compared to other. Below is the website idea.


### **Web Application for Priority-Based Task Scheduling Performance Comparison**

#### **Objective**  
This web application will allow users to create tasks, schedule them using heuristic-based scheduling algorithms, and analyze their performance. The application will be deployed on a cloud compute server (e.g., AWS EC2) and accessible through a public URL.
